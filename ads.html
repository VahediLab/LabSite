<ul>
<li><p>Interdisciplinary graduate student positions (IGG, GGR):
PhD or MD/PhD students interested in interdisciplinary positions are expected to have dry and wet lab rotations. Programming experience is preferred but not required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Graduate student positions (GCB, CIS, Bioengineering):
The general research goal is to develop statistical signal processing and machine learning methods, apply them to analyze high-dimensional genomics data, and generate multiscale causal models.
We are interested in both practical and theoretical aspects of computational biology. We are particularly interested in novel tools for the analysis of single-cell ATAC and RNA-seq data generated in the lab using C1 Fluidigm platform. 
Programming experience in Python, R, or C++, and proficiency in Linux are preferred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Postdoctoral position (Computational): The primary research focus will be on developing novel computational methods for the integration of high-dimensional genomics data sets 
both at the single and population level within the context of immune system. 
We are recruiting creative and enthusiastic recent PhD graduates with a background in statistics, computer science, electrical engineering, or physics. 
Experience in programming languages such as R, Python and C++; and proficiency in Linux are required.
Experience in high-dimensional genomic analysis i.e. next-generation sequencing data is preferred. </p>
</li>
</ul>
